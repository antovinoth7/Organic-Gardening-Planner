**Phase 0 delivered:**

- Schema migration runner (`src/migrations/`) + `schema_version` tracking on `user_settings`
- First migration: `001_backfill_district` (Kanyakumari / high_rainfall zone)
- Agro-climatic zone config extracted from `seasonHelpers.ts` into `src/config/zones/`
- `seasonHelpers.ts` functions now accept optional `zone?` param, default to `HIGH_RAINFALL_ZONE`
- Journal `tags?: string[]` field + predefined tag chips + tag filter in list view
- Fixed pre-existing broken `jest.config.js` (removed problematic setup, added `@/` path alias)
- Added tests: `seasonHelpers.test.ts` (23 tests including custom zone support)

**Phase A delivered:**

- Types: `PestEntry`, `DiseaseEntry`, `OrganicControlItem`, `PestCategory`, `DiseaseCategory`, `RiskLevel`, `TreatmentEffort`, `ControlMethod` in `database.types.ts`
- Config data: `src/config/pests/` (36 entries across 5 categories), `src/config/diseases/` (36 entries across 4 categories) with registry lookup functions
- Asset scaffolding: `src/config/referenceAssets.ts` with `getPestImage()`/`getDiseaseImage()` + `assets/reference/pests/` and `assets/reference/diseases/` directories ready for bundled WebP images
- Navigation: 4 new routes in `MoreStackParamList`, 4 screens in `AppNavigator.tsx` MoreStack, 2 new menu items in `MoreScreen.tsx`
- Styles: `referenceListStyles.ts` (search + grouped SectionList), `referenceDetailStyles.ts` (hero image, sections, treatment cards, risk badges, plant tags)
- Screens: `PestListScreen`, `PestDetailScreen`, `DiseaseListScreen`, `DiseaseDetailScreen` — grouped by category, search filter, 5 detail sections (Identification, Damage, Organic Prevention, Organic Treatment, Seasonal Risk, Plants Affected), hero image with emoji fallback
- Tests: `pests.test.ts` (13 tests), `diseases.test.ts` (12 tests) — registry shape, lookups, field completeness, treatment validation

**Phase A2 delivered:**

- Types: `Lifecycle`, `ToleranceLevel`, `FeedingIntensity`, `NumericRange` in `database.types.ts`; `PlantCareProfile` extended with 22+ optional fields (botanical identity, growing params, tolerances, nutrition/safety, user-extendable lists); `PlantCatalogCategory` extended with `tamilNames`/`descriptions`
- Data enrichment: All 100 plant varieties in `plantCareDefaults.ts` backfilled with scientific names, Tamil names (data-only), descriptions, daysToHarvest, heightCm, spacingCm, plantingDepthCm, growingSeason, germinationDays, germinationTempC, soilPhRange, tolerances, vitamins, minerals, petToxicity, feedingIntensity; fruit trees additionally have yearsToFirstHarvest
- Catalog enrichment: `tamilNames` and `descriptions` added to all 7 categories in `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG`; `normalizeCategory()` updated to merge tamilNames/descriptions from defaults
- Consumer refactor: Removed standalone `DAYS_TO_HARVEST`, `YEARS_TO_FIRST_HARVEST`, `HARVEST_SEASON_BY_VARIETY` tables from `plantHelpers.ts`; `calculateExpectedHarvestDate()` and `getDefaultHarvestSeason()` now read from enriched care profiles
- Service layer: `normalizeOverride()` in `plantCareProfiles.ts` validates all new A2 fields; `normalizeCatalog()` exported from `plantCatalog.ts`
- Migration: `002_seed_catalog_enrichment.ts` — re-normalises existing user catalogs to merge enriched defaults; `LATEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped to 2
- UI: Known Pests and Known Diseases `CollapsibleSection`s with emoji chips in ManagePlantCatalog care modal
- Tests: `plantCareDefaultsA2.test.ts` + `plantHelpersA2.test.ts` (22 tests) — field completeness, NumericRange validation, harvest date calculation, season lookup, pest/disease retrieval

## 2. Key Problems / Risks

### Critical

1. **No Schema Migration System**: Schema evolves by changing `database.types.ts` with no mechanism to transform existing data. Journal's legacy `photo_url` → `photo_filenames` migration is handled in application code. Every future schema change (harvest_logs, growth_stage_history, planting_windows) will compound this debt.
2. **Empty Catalog on First Login**: `plantCatalog` in `user_settings` starts empty until the user manually configures it, OR the normalization code merges defaults. The current `getPlantCatalog()` does merge with `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG` on read — so the catalog is technically not empty, but users don't see pre-loaded variety-level data with local context.
3. **No Onboarding**: Users land on an empty TodayScreen after signup with no guidance.

### High

1. **Hardcoded Kanyakumari Constants**: Season boundaries, location defaults ("Mangarai", "Velliavilai"), pest alerts all embedded directly in code. Expanding to other districts requires parameterization.
2. **No i18n Infrastructure**: All 13 screens and 12+ components have hardcoded English strings. Tamil support requires extracting every string first.
3. **Minimal Test Coverage**: Only 2 utility test files (`dateHelpers.test.ts`, `locations.test.ts`). Zero service tests. Zero component tests. Risk when refactoring.
4. **No Offline Mutation Queue**: Write failures during poor connectivity silently fail. `withTimeoutAndRetry()` retries but if all retries fail, the user's action is lost.

### Medium

1. **Direct Firestore Coupling**: Every service imports from `firebase/firestore`. Not a problem now but increases cost of backend migration.
2. **Large Hook**: `usePlantFormState` returns 120+ properties. Works but difficult to maintain.
3. **No Data Export**: Can export images but not plant/journal/task data. Users can't back up their actual records.

## 4. Recommended Architecture Adjustments

### 4.1 Build: Schema Migration System (G1) — ✅ Done (Phase 0)

**What**: A `src/migrations/` directory with numbered migration functions that run on app startup after auth.

**Structure**:

```text
src/migrations/
  index.ts          -- migration runner
  types.ts          -- Migration interface
  001_baseline.ts   -- no-op, establishes version 1
  002_seedCatalog.ts
  ...
```

**How it works**:

- Store `schema_version: number` in `user_settings/{uid}`
- On app launch (after auth), compare stored version vs. latest
- Run pending migrations sequentially
- Each migration transforms user's Firestore documents
- Record completed version

**Key Design Decisions**:

- Migrations run client-side (no Cloud Functions needed, stays free-tier)
- Idempotent — safe to re-run
- Batched Firestore writes (500-doc limit per batch)
- Timeout protection via existing `withTimeoutAndRetry()`

### 4.2 Build: Extract Season Config Interface — ✅ Done (Phase 0)

**What**: Move hardcoded Kanyakumari constants from `seasonHelpers.ts` into a config object, but keep Kanyakumari as the only implementation for now.

**Why now**: Every new feature (planting windows, pest calendar, weather) will embed more Kanyakumari-specific data. Extracting the config interface now prevents deeper coupling. Costs ~2 hours and pays off immediately.

**Pattern**:

- Define `SeasonConfig` interface in `database.types.ts`
- Create `src/config/kanyakumariZone.ts` exporting the current hardcoded values
- `seasonHelpers.ts` reads from the config instead of inline constants
- Add `district` field to user settings (default: "Kanyakumari")

### 4.3 Do NOT Build: Data Abstraction Layer (G19)

**Why defer**: The app has 5 service files. Each is ~200-400 lines. The Firestore SDK coupling is manageable. The abstraction would add complexity without solving a real problem today. The existing `withTimeoutAndRetry()` wrapper already centralizes retry/timeout logic. Only build this when a backend migration is actually planned.

### 4.4 Do NOT Build: Multi-User / RBAC (G20)

**Why defer**: This requires redesigning every Firestore query, security rule, and cache key. It's a fundamental architecture change, not a feature addition. Current single-farmer scope is correct for a personal app. Only revisit if actual multi-farm demand materializes.

### 4.5 Implementation Approach: Screen-by-Screen

This roadmap is organized **screen-by-screen** rather than by feature priority. Each phase targets a specific screen group, bringing it to a "done" state before moving to the next. This approach reduces context-switching for a solo developer and ensures each screen ships polished.

**Order**: Config (More tab) → Plants → Home → Calendar → Journal → Settings → Tamil i18n → Advanced

Shared foundations (types, services, config files) are built in the phase that first needs them. Each phase follows: define types → build/extend services → build/extend hooks → polish screen → write tests.

**Tamil language strategy**: Full-app English ↔ Tamil toggle in Settings (Phase G). No mixing of languages in any screen. Tamil plant names (`tamilName` on care profiles) are DATA and ship with catalog enrichment (Phase A2), but are **only displayed when the user switches to Tamil in Settings (Phase G)**. Until Phase G ships, the UI is English-only.

## 5. Phased Roadmap

### Phase 0: Stabilization (Fix Fundamentals)

**Goal**: Establish migration system and minimal test coverage so all future phases can safely change the schema and refactor code.

| Step | Feature                                       | Effort | Risk | Dependencies             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------------ |
| 0.1  | Schema Migration System                       | M      | Low  | None                     |
| 0.2  | Extract Season Config Interface               | S      | Low  | None — parallel with 0.1 |
| 0.3  | Add `schema_version` to `user_settings`       | S      | Low  | 0.1                      |
| 0.4  | Service test fixtures + first 5 service tests | M      | Low  | None — parallel          |

> **Note**: Step 0.5 (Full data backup) was originally planned for Phase 0 but moved to Phase F (Settings & Cross-Cutting).

**Verification**:

- Migration runner executes on app launch, processes pending migrations
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run lint` passes
- Service tests pass with Firebase emulator

- Plant form shows Nutrition section with vitamins/minerals chips
- Plant form shows expandable Growing / Feeding / Harvesting / Storage / Pruning narrative blocks
- Plant form shows red "Toxic to pets" warning for chives/onions; hidden for pet-safe plants

**Goal**: Full data backup and onboarding flow.
**Screens**: SettingsScreen, OnboardingScreen (NEW)

| Step | Feature                                                                                              | Effort | Risk   | Dependencies                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| F.1  | G18 full data backup — extend `backup.ts` for plants + tasks + journal + settings as JSON+images ZIP | M      | Medium | Phase 0 (migration compat)                  |
| F.2  | G17 onboarding flow — district selection (Kanyakumari default), guided first-plant wizard            | M      | Low    | Phase A2 (catalog), Phase 0 (season config) |

**Verification**:

- Export creates complete backup. Import restores all data
- New user sees onboarding flow with district selection and guided first-plant wizard

## 6. Feature-Level Breakdown

### F1: Schema Migration System (Phase 0.1)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- Add `schema_version: number` to a new `UserSettings` base interface
- Add `MigrationRecord` interface: `{ version: number; ran_at: string; status: 'success' | 'failed' }`

**New Files**:

- `src/migrations/index.ts` — migration runner with `runPendingMigrations(uid)`, reads `schema_version` from `user_settings/{uid}`, executes pending migrations
- `src/migrations/types.ts` — `Migration` interface: `{ version: number; name: string; up: (uid: string) => Promise<void> }`
- `src/migrations/001_baseline.ts` — no-op, establishes version 1

**Integration Point** (`App.tsx`):

- Call `runPendingMigrations(user.uid)` after `onAuthStateChanged` confirms user, before rendering main app
- Show migration progress indicator if migrations are running

**Service Changes**: None for baseline. Future features add migration files.

**Risks**: Migration failures mid-batch could leave partial data. Mitigation: each migration is idempotent, records progress per-document if needed.

---

### F2: Curated Default Catalog (Phase A2) — Planter-Inspired

**Scope expanded (2026-04-18)**: Extend beyond Tamil names + spacing to the full Planter-style plant-reference schema, Kanyakumari-adapted.

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- Extend `PlantCatalogCategory` with per-variety fields:

  ```typescript
  tamil_names?: Record<string, string>
  descriptions?: Record<string, string>         // per-variety prose (e.g. "Garlic chives: midway between garlic and onion")
  aliases?: Record<string, string[]>             // already exists — retained
  certifications?: Record<string, string[]>      // e.g. ['organic']
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **Botanical Identity**:

  ```typescript
  scientificNames?: string[];                    // ["Allium schoenoprasum", "Allium tuberosum"]
  taxonomicFamily?: string;                      // "Alliaceae" — enables Phase 3.2 crop rotation
  lifecycle?: 'annual' | 'biennial' | 'perennial';
  description?: string;                          // long-form, ~300–800 chars
  tamilName?: string;
  tamilDescription?: string;
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **Quick Information (all ranges, metric + °C)**:

  ```typescript
  spacing?: { valuePerSqM?: number; cmBetweenPlants?: number };
  plantingDepthCm?: { min: number; max: number };
  waterPerWeekMm?: { min: number; max: number };
  sunRange?: { min: SunlightLevel; max: SunlightLevel };
  growingSeason?: KKSeason[];                    // zone season IDs — feeds F3
  heatTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';     // replaces Planter's frostTolerance
  droughtTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // new for TN summer
  waterloggingTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // critical for SW/NE monsoons
  germinationDays?: { min: number; max: number };
  germinationTempC?: { min: number; max: number };
  heightCm?: { min: number; max: number };
  daysToHarvest?: { min: number; max: number };
  soilPhRange?: { min: number; max: number; label?: string };
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **Nutrition**, **Safety**, **Feeding intensity**:

  ```typescript
  vitamins?: string[];                           // ["A", "B9", "C", "K"]
  minerals?: string[];                           // ["calcium", "iron", "choline", "sulfur"]
  macronutrients?: string[];                     // ["fibre", "protein"]
  nutritionSource?: string;                      // "ICMR-NIN" | "USDA"
  petToxicity?: { dogs?: 'safe' | 'mild' | 'toxic'; cats?: 'safe' | 'mild' | 'toxic'; notes?: string };
  feedingIntensity?: 'light' | 'medium' | 'heavy';
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **User-Extendable Lists** (hybrid configurability — static base + user custom additions per variety):

  ```typescript
  customPests?: string[];                      // user-added pest names not in reference data
  customDiseases?: string[];                   // user-added disease names not in reference data
  customBeneficials?: string[];                // user-added beneficial critter names not in reference config
  ```

  These fields are user-additions only. Static base lists come from `getCommonPests()`/`getCommonDiseases()` in `plantHelpers.ts` and `getBeneficialsForPlant()` in `config/beneficials/`. Display merges both: `[...staticList, ...customList]`. The existing shallow spread `{ ...base, ...override }` works because custom fields don’t exist on the static base profile.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/services/plantCatalog.ts` — expand `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG` with 30–40 Kanyakumari crops, Tamil names, per-variety descriptions, TNAU-recommended varieties (Nendran, G9, ASD16, ADT37, PKM1, PLR1, East Coast Tall, TxD)
- `src/utils/plantCareDefaults.ts` — backfill the 40+ variety defaults with the full Planter-style field set above
- `src/migrations/002_seedCatalog.ts` — seeds Quick-Info, nutrition, safety, and botanical identity fields; merges with user overrides rather than overwriting

**Reuse**: Existing `getPlantCatalog()` normalization already merges defaults with user data. Existing `getPlantCareProfile()` hook auto-fills the new fields onto the form.

**Enables**: F3 (growingSeason), F9 (form sections), Phase 3.2 crop rotation (taxonomicFamily).

---

### F3: Season-Aware Planting Calendar (Phase C)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- Add `PlantingWindow` interface:

  ```typescript
  {
    canSow: boolean;
    canTransplant: boolean;
    notes: string;
  }
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with:

  ```typescript
  planting_windows?: Record<KKSeason, PlantingWindow>
  ```

- **Note (2026-04-18)**: `PlantingWindow` derivation now reads from the new `PlantCareProfile.growingSeason: KKSeason[]` field introduced in F2 rather than ad-hoc logic. For profiles without explicit `planting_windows`, infer `canSow = currentSeason ∈ growingSeason`.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/utils/plantCareDefaults.ts` — add `planting_windows` to variety-level defaults
- `src/screens/TodayScreen.tsx` — add "What to Plant Now" section using current season + care profile planting windows
- `src/styles/todayStyles.ts` — styles for new section
- `src/components/PlantNowBanner.tsx` — **NEW** zone-aware "Plant now ✅ / Wait until X" badge rendered at top of the plant edit form (replaces Planter's "Set Frost Dates" flow — Kanyakumari has no frost)

**Reuse**: `getCurrentSeason()` from `seasonHelpers.ts`, `getPlantCareProfile()` from `plantCareDefaults.ts`, zone season labels from `src/config/zones/`.

---

### F4: Weather Integration (Phase C)

**New Files**:

- `src/services/weather.ts` — `getWeatherForecast(lat, lng): WeatherForecast` with Open-Meteo API call, 3h cache via `dataCache`

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- `WeatherForecast`, `DailyWeather` interfaces

**Files Modified**:

- `src/screens/TodayScreen.tsx` — weather card showing 7-day forecast, rain alert
- `src/styles/todayStyles.ts` — weather card styles
- `src/services/tasks.ts` — optional: suppress watering reminder if rain predicted

**API**: Open-Meteo free API (no key needed):

```text
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=8.08&longitude=77.57&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum&timezone=Asia/Kolkata
```

**Kanyakumari Default Coordinates**: 8.0883°N, 77.5385°E (configurable per user later via district field)

---

### F5: Enhanced Harvest Tracking (Phase B)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
interface HarvestLog {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  plant_id: string;
  harvested_at: string; // ISO date
  quantity: number;
  unit: 'kg' | 'count' | 'bunch' | 'litre';
  quality_grade?: 'good' | 'average' | 'poor';
  destination: 'consumed' | 'sold' | 'given_away';
  sale_price?: number; // INR
  buyer_market?: string; // "Nagercoil Uzhavar Sandhai"
  photo_filename?: string;
  notes?: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

**New Files**:

- `src/services/harvests.ts` — CRUD following cache → auth → Firestore → fallback pattern
- `src/migrations/003_harvestLogs.ts` — migrate existing `JournalEntry` harvest data to `harvest_logs`
- `src/styles/harvestDashboardStyles.ts` — yield chart styles

**Files Modified**:

- `firestore.rules` — add `harvest_logs/{logId}` rules
- `src/lib/storage.ts` — add `KEYS.HARVEST_LOGS`
- `src/lib/dataCache.ts` — add `CACHE_KEYS.HARVEST_LOGS`
- `src/components/HarvestHistorySection.tsx` — read from `harvest_logs` instead of journal
- `src/screens/PlantDetailScreen.tsx` — add yield trend mini-chart (`react-native-svg` already in deps)

**Reuse**: Existing `HarvestHistorySection` component, `react-native-svg` for charts.

---

### F6: Growth Stage Progression (Phase B)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
// Add to Plant interface
growth_stage_history?: Array<{
  stage: GrowthStage;
  entered_at: string;  // ISO date
  notes?: string;
}>;
```

**Files Modified**:

- `src/services/plants.ts` — `updateGrowthStage(plantId, stage, notes?)` function
- `src/screens/PlantDetailScreen.tsx` — growth timeline visualization
- `src/utils/plantHelpers.ts` — `getDaysToHarvest(plant)` using stage history + expected dates

**Migration**: `004_growthStageHistory.ts` — initializes `growth_stage_history` with current `growth_stage` and `created_at`

---

### F7: Zone-Based Planting (Phase B)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
// Add to Plant interface
planting_zone?: 'under_canopy' | 'partial_shade' | 'open_sun' | 'border_fence' | 'raised_bed';
```

**Files Modified**:

- `src/utils/plantHelpers.ts` — extend companion logic with zone-aware rules
- `src/components/forms/EditLocationSection.tsx` — add zone picker
- `src/screens/PlantFormScreen.tsx` — show companion warnings when zone selected
- `src/services/plants.ts` — include zone in queries

**New Files**:

- `src/utils/zoneCompanionRules.ts` — zone-specific companion/antagonist matrix (pepper loves coconut shade, turmeric under banana, etc.)

---

### F8: Voice-to-Text (Phase E)

**Files Modified**:

- `src/screens/JournalFormScreen.tsx` — add microphone button next to content input
- `src/styles/journalFormStyles.ts` — mic button styles

**Dependencies**: `@react-native-voice/voice` (requires dev client, not Expo Go)

---

### F9: Planter-Style Plant Form Enrichment (Phase B)

**Goal**: Bring Planter.garden's depth to the plant-edit form — botanical identity, quick-info ranges, beneficials, nutrition, narrative care, safety — adapted for Kanyakumari (no frost; metric; monsoon-aware; pet toxicity).

**Configurability Model (Hybrid)**:

- **Fully read-only** (static config, displayed but never user-edited): botanical identity, nutrition (vitamins/minerals/superfood from ICMR-NIN/USDA), pet toxicity, companion/incompatible plants, narrative care content.
- **User-extendable** (static base + user custom additions per variety via ManagePlantCatalog care modal): pests, diseases, beneficial critters. Three new `custom*` fields on `PlantCareProfile` (see F2). ManagePlantCatalog care modal gets 3 new collapsible sections showing static chips (greyed, read-only) + user chips (removable) + "Add custom" input.
- **Per-plant observations** (existing, unchanged): `Plant.pest_disease_history` via `PestDiseaseModal`.

**Data Categorization**:

_Fully Read-Only_ (static config — no user editing):

| Field                                                       | Source                                     | Displayed On                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scientificNames`, `taxonomicFamily`, `lifecycle`           | `plantCareDefaults.ts`                     | `EditBotanicalIdentitySection`                              |
| `description`, `tamilName`, `tamilDescription`              | `plantCareDefaults.ts`                     | `EditBotanicalIdentitySection`                              |
| `vitamins`, `minerals`, `macronutrients`, `nutritionSource` | `plantCareDefaults.ts`                     | `EditNutritionSection` (read-only)                          |
| `petToxicity`                                               | `plantCareDefaults.ts`                     | `EditSafetySection` (read-only)                             |
| Companion plants                                            | `COMPANION_PLANTS` in `plantHelpers.ts`    | `EditRelationshipsSection` (read-only chips)                |
| Incompatible plants                                         | `INCOMPATIBLE_PLANTS` in `plantHelpers.ts` | `EditRelationshipsSection` (read-only chips)                |
| Quick info ranges                                           | `plantCareDefaults.ts`                     | `EditQuickInfoSection` (editable via care override pattern) |
| Narrative care                                              | `plantCareDefaults.ts`                     | `EditCareGuidanceSection` (read-only)                       |

_User-Extendable_ (static base + user custom additions per variety, edited in ManagePlantCatalog care modal):

| Field                     | Static Base                        | User Custom Field              | Edited In                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Pests for this variety    | `getCommonPests(type, variety)`    | `customPests?: string[]`       | ManagePlantCatalog care modal |
| Diseases for this variety | `getCommonDiseases(type, variety)` | `customDiseases?: string[]`    | ManagePlantCatalog care modal |
| Beneficial critters       | `getBeneficialsForPlant(ids)`      | `customBeneficials?: string[]` | ManagePlantCatalog care modal |

_Per-Plant Observations_ (existing, unchanged):

| Field                                       | Storage          | Edited In          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `pest_disease_history: PestDiseaseRecord[]` | `Plant` document | `PestDiseaseModal` |

**Merge Logic**:

`customPests`/`customDiseases`/`customBeneficials` are separate from the static lists — they don't exist on the base `PlantCareProfile`. The existing shallow spread `{ ...base, ...override }` works unchanged. Display layer merges: `[...getCommonPests(type, variety), ...override.customPests ?? []]`. Custom entries render as removable chips; static entries render as read-only greyed chips. `normalizeOverride()` in `plantCareProfiles.ts` needs only a trim/deduplicate validation pass for the 3 new array fields — no structural change to the merge algorithm.

**ManagePlantCatalog Screen Changes**:

Add 3 new collapsible sections below the existing care frequency fields in the care profile modal:

1. **Known Pests** — static reference pests as read-only greyed chips + user `customPests` as removable chips + "Add custom pest" text input
2. **Known Diseases** — same pattern as pests
3. **Known Beneficial Critters** — config beneficials as read-only chips + user `customBeneficials` as removable chips + "Add custom beneficial" input

`CareFormState` extension: add `customPests: string[]`, `customDiseases: string[]`, `customBeneficials: string[]`.

**UX Flows**:

_Adding a custom pest to a variety (e.g. "Scale Insects" for Mango)_:

1. More → Manage Plant Catalog → Fruit → Mango → care profile modal
2. Scroll to "Known Pests" — static pests shown as read-only greyed chips
3. Type "Scale Insects" → tap Add → removable chip appears
4. Save → stored in `user_settings/{uid}.plantCareProfiles.Fruit.Mango.customPests`

_Viewing pest data on a plant_:

1. PlantEditForm → `EditRelationshipsSection` shows reference pests + custom pests (merged, read-only chips)
2. Tap any pest chip → navigates to PestDetailScreen (F11 / F10)
3. "Customize in Manage Plant Catalog" link to add custom entries

_Browsing reference screens (F11 / F10)_:

1. More → Pests / Diseases / Beneficials (separate menu items)
2. Pest list → searchable list grouped by category (Sap-Sucking, Borers, etc.)
3. Tap "Aphids" → PestDetailScreen with Identification, Organic Prevention, Organic Treatment cards, Seasonal Risk, Plants Affected

_Recording an actual pest incident (per-plant history)_:

1. "Add Pest/Disease Record" on PlantEditForm → existing `PestDiseaseModal`
2. Records date, pest name, treatment, outcome → saved to `Plant.pest_disease_history`
3. This is per-plant observation history, not catalog-level reference data

**Schema additions**: All new fields live on `PlantCareProfile` (catalog-level, shared across all instances of a variety). Per-plant overrides continue to use existing `Plant` fields. No duplication. See F2 for the full extended type definition.

**New Form Components** (inserted into `PlantEditForm.tsx` between `EditCareScheduleSection` and `Plant Health`, each with colocated `*Styles.ts`):

| Component                          | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EditBotanicalIdentitySection.tsx` | Read-only: scientific names, taxonomic family, lifecycle, Tamil name, description                                                                                                                                                   |
| `EditQuickInfoSection.tsx`         | Editable (auto-filled from variety): spacing, depth, water, sun range, growing season, 3-axis tolerance, germination, height, days-to-harvest, soil pH                                                                              |
| `EditRelationshipsSection.tsx`     | Companion plants, antagonist plants, common pests, common diseases — chip rows; pest/disease/beneficial chips are **tappable deep-links** to detail pages (F10); "Customize in Manage Plant Catalog" link for adding custom entries |
| `EditBeneficialsSection.tsx`       | Horizontal `FlatList` of beneficial-critter image chips; tap → **BeneficialDetailScreen** (F10); shows merged static + custom beneficials                                                                                           |
| `EditNutritionSection.tsx`         | Read-only: vitamin/mineral/macro chip rows (ICMR-NIN/USDA source, no user editing)                                                                                                                                                  |
| `EditCareGuidanceSection.tsx`      | Expandable text blocks: Growing-from-Seed, Feeding, Harvesting, Storage (fresh/frozen/dried), Pruning                                                                                                                               |
| `EditSafetySection.tsx`            | Conditional (only if `petToxicity` present) — dog/cat badges with notes                                                                                                                                                             |

**New Reference Data**:

- `src/config/beneficials/index.ts` — registry + `getBeneficialById(id)` / `getBeneficialsForPlant(ids)`
- `src/config/beneficials/kanyakumari.ts` — ~20 regionally-meaningful species with bundled image assets (honeybees, ladybird, trichogramma, parakeets, bulbuls, dragonflies, earthworms, praying mantis, spiders, etc.)

**Supporting Component**:

- `src/components/PlantNowBanner.tsx` — zone-aware "Plant now ✅ / Wait until X" badge (see F3)

**Reuse**:

- `CollapsibleSection` — every new section
- `FloatingLabelInput`, `ThemedDropdown` — numeric inputs + unit selectors
- `getCurrentSeason()` / `getSeasonLabel()` from `seasonHelpers.ts`
- `getPlantCareProfile()` for auto-fill from selected variety
- `expo-image` with `cachePolicy="memory-disk"` for beneficial critter thumbnails
- Existing companion/antagonist helpers in `plantHelpers.ts` (770+ pairs, 30+ incompatibilities)

**Wizard changes**: None. Step 3 ("How") already covers sunlight/water/fertiliser. New fields auto-populate from variety profile on save. Add-wizard stays 3 steps.

**Tests**:

- `src/__tests__/config/beneficials.test.ts` — registry shape + lookup tests
- `src/__tests__/utils/plantCareDefaults.test.ts` — every variety has mandatory Quick Info fields populated; range `min ≤ max`
- `src/__tests__/migrations/002_seedCatalog.test.ts` — idempotent; preserves user customisations

**Risks**:

- Asset bundle growth from beneficial-critter images — mitigate with compressed WebP, ~40 KB each, ~1 MB total for 20 species
- Migration 002 must merge not overwrite — existing normalisation pattern in `plantCatalog.ts` already handles this

### F10: Beneficials + Custom Entry CRUD (Phase A3)

**Goal**: Browseable reference pages for beneficial critters as a separate More menu item, plus custom entry CRUD for pests/diseases/beneficials — adapted for organic gardening in Kanyakumari. Consolidates the existing scattered data (~52 `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS`, ~140 `TREATMENT_DETAILS`, ~37 `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP`/`DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP`, 14 crops in `TAMIL_NADU_CROP_SPECIFIC_ISSUES`) into structured reference types with detail screens.

**Prerequisite**: F11 (Phase A) implements the standalone Pest & Disease reference screens first — static config files, two list screens, two detail screens, no Firestore reads. F10 builds on top: adding the Beneficials reference, custom entry CRUD, and deep-links from plant forms. Implement F11 before F10.

**Planter Section Mapping (Organic KK Adaptation)**:

| Planter Section   | Our Equivalent                  | Notes                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identification    | **Identification** + Tamil name | Local language first                                           |
| Damage Prevention | **Organic Prevention**          | Renamed to emphasize proactive organic methods                 |
| Physical Control  | **Organic Treatment**           | Merged with existing 140+ `TREATMENT_DETAILS`                  |
| Chemical Control  | **OMITTED**                     | Organic-only app — no synthetic chemicals                      |
| Plants Affected   | **Plants Affected**             | Tappable chips navigating to plant detail                      |
| _(new)_           | **Seasonal Risk**               | Which KK seasons (summer, SW/NE monsoon, cool dry) issue peaks |

For Beneficials:

| Planter Section | Our Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Common Species | **Common Species** |
| Why Helpful | **Why Helpful** |
| How To Attract | **How To Attract** |
| Identification | **Identification** + Tamil name |
| _(new)_ | **Plants To Grow** (attract this beneficial) |
| _(new)_ | **Pests Controlled** |
| _(new)_ | **Seasonal Presence** (which KK seasons active) |

**Data Type Definitions** (`database.types.ts`):

**New Screens** (under MoreStack):

| Screen                   | Route              | Purpose                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GardenReferenceScreen`  | `GardenReference`  | 3-tab layout (Pests / Diseases / Beneficials), searchable `FlatList`, FAB to add custom entry                                                  |
| `PestDetailScreen`       | `PestDetail`       | Full detail with Identification, Organic Prevention, Organic Treatment (with recipe/method cards), Seasonal Risk badges, Plants Affected chips |
| `DiseaseDetailScreen`    | `DiseaseDetail`    | Same layout as PestDetailScreen                                                                                                                |
| `BeneficialDetailScreen` | `BeneficialDetail` | Common Species, Why Helpful, Identification, How To Attract, Plants To Grow, Pests Controlled, Seasonal Presence                               |

**New Config Files**:

- `src/config/pests/index.ts` — registry + `getPestById()` / `getAllPests()` / `getPestsForPlant(variety)`
- `src/config/pests/kanyakumari.ts` — ~40 pest entries consolidated from `plantHelpers.ts` scattered data
- `src/config/diseases/index.ts` — registry + `getDiseaseById()` / `getAllDiseases()`
- `src/config/diseases/kanyakumari.ts` — ~30 disease entries

**New Service**:

- `src/services/gardenReference.ts` — manages custom pest/disease/beneficial entries; reads/writes `user_settings/{uid}.customPestReferences`, `customDiseaseReferences`, `customBeneficialReferences`; merges static + custom for display

**New Style Files**:

- `src/styles/gardenReferenceStyles.ts`
- `src/styles/pestDetailStyles.ts`
- `src/styles/diseaseDetailStyles.ts`
- `src/styles/beneficialDetailStyles.ts`

**Navigation Changes** (`AppNavigator.tsx`):

- Add 4 routes to `MoreStack`: `GardenReference`, `PestDetail`, `DiseaseDetail`, `BeneficialDetail`
- Deep-link navigation from form screens uses `navigation.navigate('MoreTab', { screen: 'PestDetail', params: { id } })`

**Deep-Link Integration Points** (F10 → existing screens):

- `PestDiseaseModal` — pest/disease name chips become tappable, navigate to detail screen
- `EditRelationshipsSection` — pest/disease chip rows deep-link to detail screens
- `EditBeneficialsSection` — beneficial critter chips deep-link to BeneficialDetailScreen
- `PestDiseaseHistorySection` — history entries deep-link to reference pages for that pest/disease

**Custom Entry Storage** (in `user_settings/{uid}`):

```typescript
customPestReferences?: PestReference[];     // isCustom = true
customDiseaseReferences?: DiseaseReference[];
customBeneficialReferences?: BeneficialReference[];
```

**Custom Entry CRUD**:

- Add via GardenReferenceScreen FAB → form with minimal required fields (name, category, identification)
- Add via ManagePlantCatalog care modal → same form, auto-links to current variety's `customPests`/`customDiseases`/`customBeneficials`
- Edit/delete from detail screen header menu
- Custom entries appear alongside static entries in all lists, distinguished by subtle badge

**Scope Boundaries**:

_Included_:

- 4 reference screens: `GardenReferenceScreen` (3-tab container), `PestDetailScreen`, `DiseaseDetailScreen`, `BeneficialDetailScreen`
- ~130 enriched entries in static config (`src/config/pests/`, `src/config/diseases/`, `src/config/beneficials/`)
- Custom entry CRUD stored in `user_settings/{uid}` via `gardenReference.ts` service
- Deep-links from pest/disease/beneficial chips across the app (`PestDiseaseModal`, `EditRelationshipsSection`, `EditBeneficialsSection`, `PestDiseaseHistorySection`)
- FAB "+" to add custom entries from `GardenReferenceScreen`; edit/delete from detail screen header menu
- ~55 bundled reference images (WebP, ~40 KB each)
- `getMergedPests()` / `getMergedDiseases()` helpers in `plantHelpers.ts`

_Excluded (current scope)_:

- User-editable nutrition data or pet toxicity data
- User-editable companion/incompatible plant lists (Phase H candidate)
- Custom organic treatment recipes per pest
- Per-plant custom pest/disease additions (use existing `PestDiseaseModal` for per-plant observation history)

**Tests**:

- `src/__tests__/config/pests.test.ts` — registry shape, lookup, all entries have required fields
- `src/__tests__/config/diseases.test.ts` — same pattern
- `src/__tests__/services/gardenReference.test.ts` — CRUD, merge logic, custom + static deduplication

**Risks**:

- Data consolidation from scattered `plantHelpers.ts` maps into structured `PestReference`/`DiseaseReference` is the main effort — ~2 days of manual mapping
- Cross-stack navigation (from PlantEditForm in PlantsStack to MoreStack) requires `CompositeNavigationProp` — already documented in navigation standards

---

### F11: Pest & Disease Reference Screens (Phase A)

**Goal**: Two standalone browseable reference screens directly accessible from the More tab — one for Pests, one for Diseases. Each has a searchable list view (grouped by category) and a full detail page. All data is static in-app config — no Firestore reads, no migration needed. The existing scattered pest/disease constants in `plantHelpers.ts` are consolidated into structured config files under `src/config/`.

**Scope**: Static reference only. Custom entry CRUD (G30) and deep-links from plant forms (2.15) are separate steps that build on top of this foundation.

#### Field Design

| User Field        | Type                   | Source                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name              | `string`               | Keys from `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP` / `DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP`                                                                                                   |
| Scientific Name   | `string?`              | Authored per entry (e.g. _Bactrocera dorsalis_, _Ralstonia solanacearum_)                                                                                |
| Images            | `imageAsset?: string`  | Reserved for future bundled WebP assets — rendered as placeholder now                                                                                    |
| Identification    | `string[]`             | Authored: 2–4 observable field symptoms per entry                                                                                                        |
| Damage Prevention | `string[]`             | `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` filtered where `TREATMENT_DETAILS[t].method === 'cultural'`                                                                   |
| Physical Control  | `string[]`             | `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` filtered where `method === 'trap' \| 'manual'`                                                                                |
| Organic Control   | `OrganicControlItem[]` | `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` filtered where `method === 'spray' \| 'biocontrol' \| 'soil'`; each item carries `method` + `effort` from `TREATMENT_DETAILS` |
| Related Plants    | `string[]`             | Inverted from `TAMIL_NADU_CROP_SPECIFIC_ISSUES` (pest/disease → crops it affects → map to variety names in `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG`)                      |

**Physical vs Organic Control distinction** (important for Kanyakumari farmers):

- **Physical/Damage Prevention** = free, labour-based or cultural methods (traps, pruning, hygiene, crop rotation)
- **Organic Control** = prepared materials (neem oil sprays, bio-agents, soil drenches) — may require purchase or preparation time

---

#### Data Model Changes (`database.types.ts`)

Add after `JournalEntry`:

```typescript
export type PestCategory =
  | 'Sap-Sucking'
  | 'Mites & Spiders'
  | 'Borers & Larvae'
  | 'Beetles & Weevils'
  | 'Other Pests';

export type DiseaseCategory = 'Fungal' | 'Bacterial' | 'Viral' | 'Other';

export interface OrganicControlItem {
  name: string;
  method: 'spray' | 'trap' | 'biocontrol' | 'soil' | 'manual' | 'cultural';
  effort: 'easy' | 'moderate' | 'advanced';
}

export interface PestEntry {
  id: string; // kebab-slug: 'aphids', 'red-palm-weevil'
  name: string;
  scientificName?: string;
  tamilName?: string;
  category: PestCategory;
  emoji: string;
  imageAsset?: string; // future: bundled require() path
  identification: string[]; // 2–4 observable symptom strings
  damagePrevention: string[]; // cultural / preventive methods
  physicalControl: string[]; // traps, manual removal, barriers
  organicControl: OrganicControlItem[];
  relatedPlants: string[]; // variety names from DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG
}

export interface DiseaseEntry {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  scientificName?: string; // causal organism: 'Alternaria solani'
  tamilName?: string;
  category: DiseaseCategory;
  emoji: string;
  imageAsset?: string;
  identification: string[];
  damagePrevention: string[];
  physicalControl: string[];
  organicControl: OrganicControlItem[];
  relatedPlants: string[];
}
```

Union literals (not enums) for categories because the existing `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP` / `DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP` already use these exact strings — direct compatibility, no mapping layer needed.

---

#### Config File Structure (mirrors `src/config/zones/` exactly)

```text
src/config/pests/
├── types.ts          — re-exports PestEntry, PestCategory, OrganicControlItem from database.types
├── kanyakumari.ts    — KANYAKUMARI_PESTS: PestEntry[]  (36 entries)
└── index.ts          — ALL_PESTS, getPestById(), getAllPests(),
                         getPestsForPlant(varietyName), getPestsByCategory()

src/config/diseases/
├── types.ts          — re-exports DiseaseEntry, DiseaseCategory, OrganicControlItem
├── kanyakumari.ts    — KANYAKUMARI_DISEASES: DiseaseEntry[]  (31 entries)
└── index.ts          — ALL_DISEASES, getDiseaseById(), getAllDiseases(),
                         getDiseasesForPlant(varietyName), getDiseasesByCategory()
```

**Data population for kanyakumari.ts files**:

- `id` ← kebab-slug of `name` (e.g. `'black-headed-caterpillar'`)
- `category` + `emoji` ← `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP[name]` / `DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP[name]`
- `damagePrevention` ← treatments from `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` where `TREATMENT_DETAILS[t].method === 'cultural'`
- `physicalControl` ← treatments where `method === 'trap' | 'manual'`
- `organicControl` ← treatments where `method === 'spray' | 'biocontrol' | 'soil'`, enriched with `method` + `effort` from `TREATMENT_DETAILS`
- `relatedPlants` ← invert `TAMIL_NADU_CROP_SPECIFIC_ISSUES`: for each pest/disease find all 13 crop keys whose `.pests[]` / `.diseases[]` includes it; map crop key → variety names from `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG`
- `identification` ← authored (2–4 field-observable symptoms per entry, ~4h domain writing)
- `scientificName` ← authored for ~20 priority pests/diseases

**Example entry (Aphids)**:

```typescript
{

#### Navigation Changes

**`src/types/navigation.types.ts`** — extend `MoreStackParamList`:

```typescript
PestList: undefined;
PestDetail: {
  pestId: string;
}
DiseaseList: undefined;
DiseaseDetail: {
  diseaseId: string;
}
```

Add 6 convenience prop types: `PestListScreenNavigationProp`, `PestDetailScreenNavigationProp`, `PestDetailScreenRouteProp`, `DiseaseListScreenNavigationProp`, `DiseaseDetailScreenNavigationProp`, `DiseaseDetailScreenRouteProp`.

**`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`** — add 4 `Stack.Screen` entries to `MoreStack`.

**`src/screens/MoreScreen.tsx`** — fix navigation type (`NavigationProp<ParamListBase>` → typed `NativeStackNavigationProp<MoreStackParamList, 'MoreHome'>`); add 2 menu items (`bug-outline` icon → PestList, `medkit-outline` icon → DiseaseList) before the Settings item.

---

#### Screen Architecture

**Shared style files** (avoids duplicate StyleSheet definitions for structurally identical screens):

- `src/styles/referenceListStyles.ts` — shared by `PestListScreen` and `DiseaseListScreen`
- `src/styles/referenceDetailStyles.ts` — shared by `PestDetailScreen` and `DiseaseDetailScreen`

**PestListScreen / DiseaseListScreen**:

- No async loading — static config, zero Firestore reads
- `searchInput: string` (controlled) + `searchQuery: string` (300ms debounce, `useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>` — same pattern as `PlantsScreen.tsx`)
- `sections = useMemo(...)` — `getAllPests()` filtered by query, grouped into `SectionList` sections by `PestCategory`
- `SectionList` with `renderItem`, `renderSectionHeader`, `keyExtractor` all in `useCallback`; `removeClippedSubviews` + `windowSize={10}`
- Header: back button + screen title + `TextInput` search bar above the list
- Empty state: centred "No results" text when filter matches nothing

**PestDetailScreen / DiseaseDetailScreen**:

- `const pest = useMemo(() => getPestById(pestId), [pestId])` — synchronous
- Guard: if `!pest` render "Not found" fallback (no crash)
- `ScrollView` with `useSafeAreaInsets()` top/bottom + `TAB_BAR_HEIGHT` bottom padding
- Custom back-button header matching `PlantDetailScreen` pattern (`insets.top + 12`)
- **Hero**: `pest.emoji` (large) + `pest.name` (bold) + `pest.scientificName` (italic, if present) + `pest.tamilName` (if present)
- **5 content sections** (plain View cards, matching `plantDetailStyles.ts` card pattern):

| Section           | Field                | Visual                                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identification    | `identification[]`   | Bullet list prefixed with "•"                                                     |
| Damage Prevention | `damagePrevention[]` | Bullet list; `shield-checkmark-outline` icon                                      |
| Physical Control  | `physicalControl[]`  | Bullet list; `hand-left-outline` icon                                             |
| Organic Control   | `organicControl[]`   | Row: method emoji + name + `getTreatmentEffortDot(effort)` from `plantHelpers.ts` |
| Related Plants    | `relatedPlants[]`    | Wrapping chip row; tap → `ManagePlantCatalog`                                     |

**Reused from existing code**:

- `getTreatmentEffortDot(effort)` → 🟢/🟡/🔴 (`plantHelpers.ts`)
- `TREATMENT_METHOD_META` pattern → method emoji (spray=💨, trap=🪤, biocontrol=🐞, soil=🌱, manual=✋, cultural=🔄) (`plantHelpers.ts`)
- `TAB_BAR_HEIGHT` (`FloatingTabBar`)
- `useSafeAreaInsets`, `useTheme`, `useNavigation`, `useRoute` — standard screen setup
- Card/section visual patterns from `plantDetailStyles.ts` (copy rules, don't import)
- 300ms debounce pattern from `PlantsScreen.tsx`

**Modified files**: `database.types.ts`, `navigation.types.ts`, `AppNavigator.tsx`, `MoreScreen.tsx`

---

#### Tests

- `src/__tests__/config/pests.test.ts` — `getAllPests()` = 36 items; every entry has `id`, `name`, `category`, `emoji`; `getPestById('aphids')` returns correct entry; `getPestById('nonexistent')` = `undefined`; `getPestsForPlant('Country Tomato')` includes Aphids; all `organicControl[].method` values are valid union members
- `src/__tests__/config/diseases.test.ts` — same structural tests for 31 diseases
- `src/__tests__/fixtures/pestEntry.fixtures.ts` — `makePestEntry(overrides?)` factory
- `src/__tests__/fixtures/diseaseEntry.fixtures.ts` — `makeDiseaseEntry(overrides?)` factory

---

#### Verification Criteria

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` exits zero
2. `npm run lint` exits zero
3. `getAllPests()` = 36, `getAllDiseases()` = 31 (data completeness check)
4. More tab shows "Pest Reference" and "Disease Reference" menu items
5. PestListScreen renders all 36 pests grouped under 5 category headings
6. Search "weevil" filters within 300ms to matching pests; clear restores full list
7. Tapping a pest row navigates to `PestDetailScreen` — all 5 sections populated
8. Organic Control items show effort dots (🟢/🟡/🔴) and method emoji
9. Tapping a Related Plants chip navigates to `ManagePlantCatalogScreen`
10. Back button from any screen returns correctly without stack issues
11. Light mode and dark mode render correctly (no hardcoded hex values)
12. `DiseaseListScreen` / `DiseaseDetailScreen` behave identically with disease data

## 7. Data & Migration Strategy

### Migration System Design

1. **Version tracking**: `user_settings/{uid}.schema_version` (integer, starts at 0)
2. **Migration files**: `src/migrations/NNN_descriptiveName.ts`, each exports `{ version, name, up(uid) }`
3. **Runner**: `src/migrations/index.ts` — `runPendingMigrations(uid)`:
   - Read current `schema_version`
   - Filter migrations where `version > current`
   - Run sequentially
   - Update `schema_version` after each success
   - Log failures to Sentry, don't crash app
4. **Idempotency**: Each migration checks if transformation already applied before modifying
5. **Batch limits**: Process max 500 docs per `writeBatch()` (Firestore limit)

### Migration Timeline (by Phase)

| Migration              | Phase      | Schema Change                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 001_backfill_district  | Phase 0 ✅ | District + zone backfill (Kanyakumari / high_rainfall)                      |
| 002_seedCatalog        | Phase A    | Enriches catalogs with Tamil names/varieties, botanical identity, nutrition |
| 003_harvestLogs        | Phase B    | Creates `harvest_logs` from journal harvest entries                         |
| 004_growthStageHistory | Phase B    | Initializes `growth_stage_history` from current stage                       |
| 005_plantingZones      | Phase B    | Adds `planting_zone` to plants                                              |

> **Removed from plan**: `003_plantingWindows` — planting windows are config data on care profiles, not user data requiring migration. `007_journalTags` — already shipped in Phase 0.

### Risky Data Changes

- **004_harvestLogs**: Creates new collection from existing journal data. Must NOT delete original journal entries (they remain as the source of truth). Harvest logs are a materialized view.
- **002_seedCatalog**: Must merge with user customizations, not overwrite. Use existing normalization pattern in `plantCatalog.ts`.

## 8. Final Recommendations

### DO NOW (Phase A–A2 — Config)

1. **Build Pest & Disease reference screens (F11)** — static config, no Firestore, simplest standalone start
2. **Enrich default catalog (F2)** — highest-ROI content work, data foundation for everything. Pest/disease chips deep-link to Phase A screens.
3. **Build Beneficials + custom entry CRUD (F10)** — separate More menu item, completes reference set

### DO NEXT (Phase B–C — Plants & Home)

1. **Planter-style form depth (F9)** — 7 new sections, high perceived polish
2. **Harvest tracking (F5)** — concrete value farmers care about
3. **Growth stage + zone-based planting (F6, F7)** — tracks living plant progress
4. **Deep-links from forms to reference screens (2.15)** — connects form chips to detail pages
5. **"What to Plant Now" on TodayScreen (F3)** — farmers' #1 question, leverages enriched profiles
6. **Weather card (F4)** — simple API call, high daily-use value

### DO AFTER (Phase D–F)

1. **Calendar weather refinements (Phase D)** — watering suppression on rainy days
2. **Voice-to-text Tamil (F8, Phase E)** — removes literacy barrier
3. **Full data backup (G18, Phase F)** — data loss is a trust-breaker
4. **Onboarding flow (G17, Phase F)** — district selection + guided first-plant wizard

### DO LATER (Phase G–H)

1. **Tamil i18n** — only after all screens feature-complete (extracting strings from moving targets is waste)
2. **Crop rotation, farm mapping, soil recs, lifecycle economics** — deeper domain intelligence

### DO NOT BUILD (Current Stage)

| Feature                    | Reason                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-User / RBAC          | Rewrites entire data model. No demand from a personal-use app.                           |
| Financial Ledger           | Accounting is a different product. Start with `sale_price` on harvest_logs.              |
| Data Abstraction Layer     | 5 small service files don't justify the abstraction cost. Build when migrating backends. |
| Labour Tracking            | Niche enterprise need. Track worker costs as notes on task_logs for now.                 |
| Water Management Module    | Covered by weather integration + existing watering tasks.                                |
| State-Level Zone Expansion | Build Kanyakumari bulletproof first. Other zones = same template with different data.    |
| Government Scheme Tracker  | External data dependency with no reliable API. Link to websites instead.                 |
| Full Plot GPS Mapping      | String-based zones + bed names are sufficient for half an acre.                          |

### Architecture Principles for All Phases

1. **Schema changes go through migrations** — no more "hope old data works"
2. **New collections follow the existing service pattern** — cache → auth → Firestore → fallback
3. **Domain data is config, not code** — season boundaries, pest alerts, planting windows should be data objects, not inline logic
4. **Static reference data stays in-app** — organic recipes, farmer's almanac, pest reference images are app assets, not Firestore (keeps free-tier viable)
5. **Test new services** — every new service file (`harvests.ts`, `weather.ts`) gets unit tests from day one

## Design Decisions (Open for Discussion)

### Coconut Per-Tree Tracking Model

- **Option A**: `tree_number` field on `HarvestLog` linking to existing `Plant` entry — simpler, "harvested 45 nuts from tree #7"
- **Option B**: Separate `CoconutTree` child collection under a parent `Plant` — supports per-tree care schedules
- **Recommendation**: Option A first. Upgrade to B only if farmers need per-tree watering/fertilising differences.

### Farmer's Almanac Location

- **Option A**: Static content rotating monthly on `TodayScreen`
- **Option B**: Dedicated screen in More tab with full-year view
- **Recommendation**: Both — monthly highlight on TodayScreen with "View full almanac" link.

### Voice-to-Text Library

- `expo-speech` handles TTS only, not STT
- `@react-native-voice/voice` requires dev client (not Expo Go), supports Tamil well
- **Recommendation**: `@react-native-voice/voice` since `expo-dev-client` is already in use.

### Harvest Logs vs. Extended Task Logs

- **Option A**: New `harvest_logs` collection — clean separation, purpose-built fields (sale_price, buyer_market, destination)
- **Option B**: Extend existing `task_logs` with harvest fields — less migration, reuses existing service
- **Recommendation**: Option A. Harvests have fundamentally different data needs (quantity, market, income) that don't fit the task completion model.
